# Analyzing Student's Mental Health in SQL

Does studying abroad affect your mental health? In this project, I explored data from a 2018 survey conducted by a Japanese international university to find out.

The goal was to see if there's a relationship between how long international students stay abroad and their mental health scores, specifically looking at depression, social connectedness, and stress from adapting to a new culture.

I used SQL to group students by their length of stay and calculate average scores for each mental health metric. The query filters for international students only, then shows how their average test scores change depending on how many years they've been studying abroad.

What I found was interesting: students who stayed longer tended to have better social connectedness and lower stress levels compared to those who just arrived. It makes sense when you think about it, the longer you're somewhere, the more you adapt and build connections.

Built with PostgreSQL and Jupyter Notebook.
